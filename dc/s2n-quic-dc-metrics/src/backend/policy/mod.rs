//! A [`Backend`] wrapper that filters and pre-aggregates metrics per a [`Policy`], in front of any
//! inner backend.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! `s2n-quic-dc` registers the same metric name once per worker/sender with a distinct
//! [aggregation](crate::MetricInfo::aggregation) variant (`worker|send.5`, …). Every such series is
//! its own line on the wire, so per-worker metrics multiply cardinality and throttle downstreams
//! like CloudWatch. [`Filtered`] lets a deployment collapse that cardinality **per backend** — e.g.
//! statsd collapses per-worker loss into one series while the querylog/tracing path keeps every
//! worker for debugging — without touching any existing backend: the wrapper feeds an inner backend
//! already-collapsed records through the normal [`Backend`] calls.
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! A [`Policy`] is a set of rules. Each rule has a [`Matcher`] and an [`Action`]:
//! [`Keep`](Action::Keep) (forward verbatim), [`Drop`](Action::Drop) (filter the metric out of this
//! backend entirely), or [`Collapse`](Action::Collapse) (merge the metric across one aggregation key
//! — summing counters, bool sides, gauge/callback values, and merging histogram buckets — and
//! re-emit one series with that key removed).
//!
//! A [`Matcher`] is a **predicate tree** over three leaf kinds — the metric name
//! ([`name`](Matcher::name)/[`prefix`](Matcher::prefix)/[`glob`](Matcher::glob)), its
//! [metadata tags](crate::MetricTags)
//! ([`tag`](Matcher::tag)/[`tag_present`](Matcher::tag_present)/[`tag_any_of`](Matcher::tag_any_of)/[`tag_glob`](Matcher::tag_glob)),
//! and its emitted aggregation keys ([`agg_key`](Matcher::agg_key)) — combined with
//! [`all`](Matcher::all)/[`and`](Matcher::and) (AND), [`any_of`](Matcher::any_of)/[`or`](Matcher::or)
//! (OR), and [`not`](Matcher::not) (NOT). So `send.* AND level=debug`, `send.* OR recv.*`, and
//! `NOT tx.acked.frame.*` are all expressible.
//!
//! Each rule has an explicit **priority**; the highest-priority matching rule wins (ties broken by
//! later declaration). Convenience constructors default a rule's priority from its matcher's shape
//! (exact name > prefix > glob > tag/aggregation-only > broad), so the common case needs no manual
//! ordering, but [`rule_with_priority`](Policy::rule_with_priority) overrides it. A metric matched by
//! no rule passes straight through unchanged; an explicit high-priority [`Keep`](Action::Keep) opts
//! a metric back in over a broader `Drop`/`Collapse`. Resolution is memoized per distinct metric
//! identity, so the rule scan runs once per metric no matter how many reports pass.
