//! A pull-based [`Backend`] that maintains cumulative Prometheus series in memory and renders the
//! [text exposition format] on demand.
//!
//! # Why this backend is different
//!
//! Unlike the statsd/querylog backends, which format each report's values and forward them
//! immediately, Prometheus is **pull-based** and its counters/histograms must be **cumulative and
//! monotonic**. But [`Registry::report`](crate::Registry::report) is *destructive*: it drains each
//! counter and histogram to zero every pass, handing the backend only the delta since the last
//! report. This backend therefore keeps its own authoritative, cumulative state and *accumulates*
//! each delta into it:
//!
//! - counters add the delta into a running total;
//! - gauges and callbacks (instantaneous readings) take the latest value (last-write-wins);
//! - histograms accumulate per-bucket counts, plus a running sum and observation count.
//!
//! A scrape endpoint reads the state through a [`PrometheusHandle`]. To keep the scrape path cheap
//! and off the reporting hot path, the backend re-encodes the full snapshot into the exposition
//! string once per report (in [`report_end`](Backend::report_end)) and publishes it behind a shared
//! cell; `encode` just clones the published `Arc<str>`. Values only change at report boundaries
//! anyway (that is when the registry drains), so a per-report snapshot loses no fidelity.
//!
//! # Name and label mapping
//!
//! Metric names are sanitized to the Prometheus grammar (`[a-zA-Z0-9_:]`, e.g. `rx.data` ->
//! `rx_data`). The historical `aggregation` convention string becomes labels: `Variant|ect0` ->
//! `{variant="ect0"}`, `Task|foo` -> `{task="foo"}`, and a bare string with no `|` -> its own
//! `aggregation` label. Bool counters collapse into a single counter family with a `result="true"`
//! / `result="false"` label.
//!
